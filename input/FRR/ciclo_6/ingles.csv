Because of Covid-19  the libraries closed, and due to their own budget reductions some mayors foregoed their obligations to pay the libraries’ salaries and internet.","Riecken feels it critical to renegotiate agreements with these mayors before the 2021 election year arrives and campaigning becomes a major focus of the mayors’ time and attention.  As places of civic engagement, Riecken libraries serve as information centers for students, entreprenuers and community members  to develop post-Covid recovery strategies.","Library leaders in municipalities that are severely at-risk for post-Covid-19 financial cutbacks will advocate for the libraries’ safe reopening.

","As Honduras and Guatemala’s fall 2020 national and municipal primary election season launches, Riecken’s objective is to train library associations and its Guatemalan and Honduran library network, including board members and volunteers, to advocate for the safe, post-Covid-19 reopening of its libraries and continued local funding for their ongoing operation.","By convening and engaging library leaders in advocacy strategies.  
Riecken hopes to achieve the safe reopening of its library network and secure the financial and political support of elected officials to ensure that the libraries can continue to serve as places of civic engagement and learning for the rural communities.

Training in basic community advocacy skills contributed to 65 libraries opening over a 20 year period.",No,,"Riecken’s mission is to promote democracy and prosperity in Central American communities by awakening a spirit of discovery and social participation. Its 65 libraries are democratic institutions that demonstrate transparent, inclusive governance to which other institutions can aspire. Community members engage in open, democratic discussions to identify local issues/solutions.","After six months of shuttered schools, libraries and businesses, children are in urgent need of intellectual re-engagment, entrepreneurs need places to develop and launch post-Covid marketing plans, and community members need a place for civic engagement to help ensure that businesses, schools, etc. can develop post-pandemic strategies to recover.","Month #1: Work with library association leaders to organize materials and speak with communities regarding advocacy training;

Month #2:  Train Guatemalan libraries, and libraries in two Honduran regions to discuss the current Covid-19 and political situation in their communities.  Develop regional advocacy strategies and determine the materials needed to ensure the libraries’ safe reopening;
