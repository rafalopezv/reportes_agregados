Our work will contribute to a coalition of NGOs formed to address ecological concerns in the new Constitution.  COVID-19 adds to the pressure on the government to favor short-term jobs over sustainable development.","This is a once in a lifetime chance to write environmental protection law as a human right into Chile's Constitution, thereby strengthening the Constitution as a tool for activists and others to achieve conservation outcomes and to support legal cases favoring sustainable development. ","To make it a Constitutional right of Chileans to government transparency, the protection of biodiversity, and a pollution-free environment. ","To use our experience achieving national policy in Chile and our scientific knowledge to draft, gather stakeholder support, and lead a public communications campaign to support for our position.  Once the Constitutional Committee is formed this month, we will spend two years getting environmental protection written into the Constitution.

",No,,"Traditionally excluded and marginalized people, especially people who are poor and Indigenous, suffer the most from unsustainable development and environmental injustice in Chile. Constitutional protection for their rights to a healthy environment will give environmental lawyers and activists critical new protection at the highest level.

","This is Phase 1 of a two-year project ending on October 23, 2022 with the vote on reforms.  We have worked with lawyers and other experts to analyze court decisions affecting environmental protection and blocking transparency. We have a report (available) that identifies weaknesses and proposes solutions.  With funding, we will lead two stakeholder workshops to develop a shared agenda for constitutional reforms, with an ocean focus, and develop a public statement as part of the FEMA coalition.
