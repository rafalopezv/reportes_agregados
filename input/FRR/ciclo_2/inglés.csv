We promote our mission by partnering with high-schools to develop and deliver engaging, civic-oriented learning experiences that provide students with the opportunity to learn about the rule of law while developing their abilities to think critically, work collaboratively and speak with impact.  The specific action proposed here has the objective of developing a Spanish language version of our curriculum and associated teacher support materials. ","The goal of this project is to  expand  our current English language based educational programs to  accommodate high-schools with Spanish as the primary/only learning language. ","As a result of this project, our program offering will include a Spanish language option in addition to the current English-based implementation. ","Mexico is suffering from rule of law issues that are at the root of the country's serious problems of social disparity, corruption and violence.  Right now, their are people suffering throughout this country who are in desperate need of effective advocates to support social justice.  Funding at this time will allow us to addresses this need by developing an offering that is accessible, relevant and timely.  With in-person learning suspended due to the COVID pandemic, we have an unique opportunity to dedicate resources to preparing a program that is relevant to the majority of the population we serve and that can be implemented in conjunction with a full-time return to in-person learning in the 2021-2022 academic year.   By inspiring our future leaders, igniting their passion and potential to advocate for justice, we share in  Rapid Response Fund's goal of triggering public discussions and civic engagement.","There are two tasks on this project's critical path 1) Localization of the current English-Language curriculum and 2) Preparation of Multimedia Support for Teachers/Students.
1) Localization.
Our current academic program  is offered only in English and is based on on the substantive and procedural laws of the United States. This limits the applicability of the  program to those schools/students with English language capabilities, i.e., American and International Schools. The task calls for developing a comparable curriculum that is in Spanish and based on relevant Mexican legal standards.  Funding will be used to contract a Subject Matter Expert who will work in conjunction with our internal resources to develop a standards-based curriculum  including Unit Plans, Lesson Plans and Teacher Guide. 
2) Multimedia Support
Currently we use a number of videos available online (via youtube and other sites) to supplement student learning activities and facilitate teacher training.  For the most part these resources are free and easily accessible. However, they are all in English and we have not been able to find Spanish language alternatives. This task will  comparable Spanish language video series.  These videos will be based on the output of task 1. Videos will be scripted and performed by current students and teacher volunteers with funding going to production costs. ","Risk 1 - Subject Matter Expertise: Securing a qualified and available Subject Matter Expert (SME) is an essential requirement to this project's critical path.   R1 Mitigation Strategies -  a) Expand our range of potential resources by allowing for remote, i.e., online, collaboration between internal resources and and the SME;  b) Work in conjunction with our University and Legal Industry partners to identify multiple SME candidates across a broad geographic range. 
Risk 2 - COVID:  Social distancing requirements in Mexico may interfere with video production. R2 Mitigation Strategies - a) Allow/Provide for remote collaboration on scripting and rehearsals; b) Allow/facilitate an all remote vs. in-person  filming option. ","Due to COVID isolation mandates imposed by Federal and Local authorities, we have canceled our in-person learning, including a plan expansion for the 2020-2021 academic year. This situation presents an opportunity in the form of increased bandwidth on the part of our internal  resources who are currently working remotely.  We can leverage this free bandwidth to work on the proposed project."

This has increased gross human rights violations in the past 6-12 months. This has also been done under the guise of the Covid19 pandemic. Journalists have been arrested and denied bail, citizens have been denied their constitutional right to demonstrate. Rural communities have been intimidated into voting for certain candidates and vote buying is a predominant activity in rural communities. The constitution states that women and youths have a 50% quota representation in parliament and government but this is not being realised. The internet is being switched off and voices of those advocating for human rights are being silenced by either imprisonment, intimidation or death. This has made the human rights advocacy and civic space activities be operated under intense fear of reprisal from security forces. This is exactly what the project aims to address and why it is relevant to fund this project before civic society space is completely shut in Zimbabwe ","Craneshaw Heights Trust will do Digital Advocacy Campaigns which include  Social Media Advocacy Campaigns from September 2020 to February 2021. The advocacy will be done using flyers, viral content and targeted content creation. This will be also done through Adwords and Search Engine optimization.

1. Government persecution and arrests - This will be mitigated through impartiality in project implentation and focusing on clean non politically affiliated program implementation
2. Covid19 Induced lockdowns - this will be mitigated through adhering to stipulated numbers in workshops and perfomances and ensuring Covid19 safe practices are followed in every activity 
3. Appearing as a political party to citizens - this will be mitigated through constant message that ensures civilians of the organisation's neutrality ","1. The increase in digital population in Zimbabwe and the lockdown restrictions make it favourable to advocate through social media and the digital space.

Cameroon Network for Humanitarian Services, 4. Child Relief Services","Joanes Toulac Jang",joanesjang@gmail.com,"Four Months","$14,980",Cameroon,"The project ""Mobilizing the Power of Marginalized People to Reshape Civic Space in Cameroon' seek to engage men, women and children benefiting from the targeted CSOs’ programmes, particularly socially excluded
communities and groups, and wider civil society to formulate a strong and consolidated response to defend their common space for engagement, debate and action. Shrinking civic space muffles citizens’ voices and threatens civil society’s very existence.

Being deeply concerned about this, Partners for Relief and Development organization in partnership with four network CSO members  joins forces with citizens, other civil society actors, and their allies to defend our common space. As civil society actors and Cameroon citizens, we cannot wait until there is no space left for our voices and actions. Any restriction on civic space threatens our basic rights as citizens. Shrinking space challenges our legitimacy as civil society actors to advocate for equality and justice. It undermines the social contract between citizens and governments. It reduces our ability to contribute to poverty reduction and inclusive development. It limits our means to effectively respond in a humanitarian crisis. Fundamentally, shrinking space challenges our collective power as people to determine our own futures.
Defending civic space is not the responsibility of only one part of civil society – such as human rights organizations or activists. It is the diversity, breadth and vibrancy of civil society that has the potential to successfully reclaim and create civic space. Committed and coordinated actions from activists, academics, journalists, civil society organizations, progressive policy makers and other allies are needed to reverse the trend of shrinking civic space.

Overall objective: To strengthen civil society actors’ capacity to address and effectively influence the participation of marginalization and underrepresented people such as domestic workers, delivery workers, groups in rural communities, indigenous peoples in decision making processes that affects their lives, families and communities.
Specific objectives: 1) To strengthen the organizational capacity of four Civil Society Organizations across four regions in Cameroon and support them to advocate the participation of marginalization and underrepresented people such as domestic workers, delivery workers, groups in rural communities, indigenous peoples in decision making processes that affects their lives, families and communities.
2) To contribute to an enabling policy framework and environment for the participation of marginalization and underrepresented people by strengthening their capacity to engage with different power holders (local government, Councils and traditional leaders)","In Cameroon, space for marginalized people to speak out, organize and take action against poverty, inequality and injustice is shrinking. Many face serious restrictions and repression when exercising their basic human rights. This includes Anglophones from the North West and South West, Pygmies from South and Mbororos from the North. The Project seek to empower them to raise their voices against marginalization, corruption social, economic and political dysfunction and also empower organizations provide basic services to people in need, defend their rights, provide sustainable livelihoods and demand a fair share of natural resources, and activists who fight for justice.","1) Strengthened capacity of four CSOs, particularly those representing marginalized and vulnerable groups, to engage in development and rights programmes on issues affecting them.
 2) Increased engagement of  CSOs  and underrepresented populations in policy and advocacy
processes at different levels to influence power holders and hold them to account. 
3) Strengthened linkages and networking between CSOs to address development issues and promote an
enabling environment for civil society to thrive. 
4) Empowered  citizens, particularly from marginalized communities, are able to engage in issues that affect them, thus strengthening democracy and governance.","The global trend of shrinking civic space mutes citizens’ voices and threatens civil society’s very existence. Without space to speak out, organize, and take action, progress on inclusive development is severely constrained. The growing and worrying phenomenon of shrinking civic space in Cameroon hampers citizens from freely exercising their fundamental human rights. The number of restrictive laws proposed by governments have risen significantly. These laws—which include legislation on associations and counterterrorism hinder the rights to the freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly by restricting civil society’s registration, operation, and financial resources. For example, the Cameroonian government impedes foreign donor agencies from funding NGOs and requires all donor funds to flow through government ministries. Local community based organizations are only allowed to receive funding if there is insufficient capacity in the ministry. In addition, the government limits NGOs from promoting and engaging in human rights activities and requires the government’s prior approval for social and political gatherings that involve more than ten persons.
This dire situation calls for a new approach that mobilizes citizens’ response to these restrictive measures. Current initiatives focus more on highlighting and amplifying the various dimensions of shrinking space through documentation, and policy advocacy at national levels. However, effectively addressing the crisis confronting civil society in Cameroon requires developing citizens’ skills and knowledge on effective measures to address human rights violations. The project seeks to engage local marginalized people through public education, awareness raising and participation of CSOs groups, voluntary associations, citizens’ movements, and community-based organizations.","First Month -  Developing Term of Reference (ToR) and setting up advisory group  and orientation of advisory group.
Second month- Undertaking advocacy initiatives. i)  Advocacy on CSO identified issues (by CSOs) and  b) Advocacy on enabling framework (by CSOs)
Third month - Facilitating linkages and networking  by supporting the organizational development of  underrepresented people
Forth Month - Building an evidence base by documentation of good practice, creating wider public awareness, media coverage of CSOs  and underrepresented people  and outreach to the public to amplify  their voices. ","1) The political space for CSOs shrinks and erodes, leading to increasing pressure on CSOs. 
Mitigation: The action will continuously monitor the situation and
engage with multiple stakeholders to advocate for maintaining the space for CSOs to operate in Cameroon. Civil society action in itself functions to maintain and expand the space. 
2) Increased conflict, either through the unraveling of the ceasefire process in the North and South West regions or communal tensions, leading to difficulties for CSOs to operate on the ground.  
Mitigation: Based on the context, concern CSOs will assess whether it is possible to continue activities, and a joint decision will be taken in case activities need to be shifted.
3) Planned local elections coming up might make it difficult for CSOs to operate. 
Mitigation: The context will be continuously monitored. The elections also provide an opportunity for CSOs and communities to influence power holders and voice their demands","Even though the government has put in place restrictive conditions for CSOs and human right defenders to work on the one hand, the double current crisis (COVID-19 and Anglophone conflicts) situation in Cameroon on the other hand is forcing the government to relax on her own laws. A number of conditions remain favourable that make the implementation of the project possible with the time from.
1. CSOs in Cameroon continue to be open to engaging with other CSOs and stakeholders, and collaborate
with each other
2.  Power holders are open to engaging with CSOs at different levels (local, state/regional, national)
3. The legal and policy framework continues to allow CSO activity
4.  Donors continue to prioritize CSO strengthening and they continues to receive funds to support its larger programme in line with its current government priorities to engage citizens in finding lasting solutions to the current problems.


The increasing number of initiatives presents an opportunity to empower citizens to effectively respond to the risks associated with closing civic space. A promising strategy is that government is making efforts to ensure that learning resources are accessible for citizens and human rights activists working at all levels, especially within grassroots constituencies."
